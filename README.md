# Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Web App Using AWS Sagemaker

![](https://github.com/ObinnaIheanachor/Sentiment-Analysis-Sagemaker-Deployment/blob/master/NLP.gif)

## Project Overview
In this project, I have built a Sentiment Analysis RNN Model using Pytorch on [IMDB's movies dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) and deployed the model as a simple web app using AWS Sagemaker.
A user can submit his/her review as text and get instant feedback on the sentiment of the review.
Below is an image of the data flow from App to Model and back.
